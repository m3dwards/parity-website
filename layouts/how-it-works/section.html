                    <p>Parity is a Birmingham business network with the option to buy and sell without using pounds.</p>

                    <p>The local currency is additional liquidity and not a replacement for your existing finances.</p>

                    <p>It is simply another line on your business balance sheet and treated like any other asset.</p>
