## Jewellery Quarter Pubs


### 8 places to discover in the Jewellery Quarter

Being part of the jewellery Quarter community has been great and we have quickly learnt that the Jewellery Quarter in Birmingham is a vibrant neighbourhood. In the morning people come here to work while In the evening - probably even from the afternoon -, people reach the Jewellery Quarter to enjoy nice food, a pint and, why not, some live music.
