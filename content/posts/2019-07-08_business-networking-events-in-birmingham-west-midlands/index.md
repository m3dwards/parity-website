## Business Networking Events in Birmingham, West Midlands.


At Parity we believe in networking, not only as part of our business operations, but also as a way to improve ourselves and learn new things from other people. Luckily, the Birmingham area is rich with opportunities and you have the chance to engage in these business networking events over the course of the coming week.

Below are a list of  events where you can attend to meet local entrepreneurs, and while your there why not meet someone from Parity and find more about this [innovative business network](/about-us).

## Business events on Tuesday, 9th July 2019

Our networking schedule starts on the 9th of July. As every second Tuesday of the month, in the “Grosvenor Casino Birmingham” at 10am there will be another [Brummies Networking](https://brummies-networking.co.uk/) event and on the same morning Parity will be also elsewhere. Indeed, in the Solihull College &amp; University Centre our team will participate in the workshop [Instagram for Business](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/instagram-for-business-tickets-64167518776). In the 21st century is important to know how to use social media and what’s better than an event merging online and offline networking?
