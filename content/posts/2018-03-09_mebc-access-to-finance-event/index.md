## MEBC Access to Finance Event


<span style="color: #000000;">The <a href="http://mebc.org.uk/" style="color: #000000;">Midlands Environmental Business Company</a> is hosting a SME access to finance event in Birmingham, West Midlands. The event will help business owners decide what small business finance is available to SMEs in the region.
