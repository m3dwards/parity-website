## WIR Bank Switzerland - An inspiration for Credex


WIR Bank has been addressing local SMEs lack of liquidity since when it was established in 1934 .The solution proposed consists of interest-free credit usable inside a business network. It provides local SMEs of the missing liquidity to incur expenditures and keep working despite financial constraints. ore than a small business loan, it is a way to fund a business through a facility like an business overdraft that doesn’t charge overdraft fees. This complementary funding source for businesses can be recovered by selling goods and services to other participants.



WIR builds business credit without personal guarantee; instead the business loan requirement consists in spare capacity and untapped potential. WIR offers an easy solution for business funding; it helps companies who are looking for fast business loans and cheap business loans. This credit has been issued in complementary currency named WIR (CHW); equal to Swiss Franc (CHF) [1 CHF = 1 CHW] but not convertible. Due to its complementary and additional nature this currency allows to trade not affecting CHF operating cash flow and it saves hidden costs and any other bank charges.



Besides getting fundings for businesses, WIR is also a business network that boosts local trade and local networking. It offers to enterprises interest free business credit and a business network of potential customers and suppliers. Nowadays WIR network consists of about 60’000 accounts, 45’000 SMEs and 15’000 owners who have decided to participate also as individual. The WIR’s transactions volume is equivalent to €1 billion and it contributes for about 2% of Swiss GDP (5). Transactions in the network tend to be blended and both currencies are used simultaneously. A minimum acceptance quota of CHW is set at 3% but entrepreneurs can deliberately choose another percentage; also 100% in CHW (5).



In order to facilitate internal trade WIR Bank is also committed in proactive services. Firstly, it offers sales support by means of brokering service design to match internal demand and supply. Furthermore WIR Bank is also giving visibility to its members encouraging mutual knowledge among participants. Marketing services are both online, in WIR marketplace, and offline through networking events and meetup for business networking. Currently WIR cost is 150 CHF p.a. plus 2% of WIR’s turnover to pay in CHF as contribution to the network (5).



In respect of WIR researchers have identified  its velocity of circulation and its countercyclicality Velocity instead is the ratio between money available and transactions occurred; which is WIR the money is used more times than in Euros. The counter cyclical nature of WIR means that its activity increases during recession or financial hardship; when credit is constrained or too expensive through the main banking sector.



WIR Bank is a huge inspiration for Credex, we think that it should be replicated here in the West Midlands. If we can establish a similar sized business credit network, zero interest credit would boost trade and provide a lifeline to businesses in recessions. We are working to develop our network and aim to launch in January 2019.
